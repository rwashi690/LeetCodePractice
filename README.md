# LeetCodePractice
This repository documents mutiple practice problems to improve my coding skills. It pulls questions primarily from LeetCode. However, there are also problems from my Georgia Tech Bootcamp, Hacker Rank and Codility.

## How to use this repository for interview prep
Currently this repository does not have answers and questions separated and that will be done in the future. Problems are solved in JS and in the future Python will be added. Not all problems are currently solved.
